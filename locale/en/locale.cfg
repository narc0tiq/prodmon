[mod-setting-description]
prodmon-sample-frequency=How often samples are taken -- impacts Production Monitor's use of system resources.\nLess often than default (60 ticks) will result in better performance, but less timely information.\n60 ticks = 1 second.
prodmon-sample-count=The rate of change of signals is calculated from a number of historic samples, with the oldest samples having the most impact on the calculation.\nSetting this higher than the default (16 samples) may result in better accuracy, but it will take longer for changes in the depletion/growth rate of signals to be visible.
